# National Parks Search App Project

This was an assignment as part of [Thinkful's Full-Stack Flex Program](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/flexible/). 

It is a simple search app utilizing the National Parks API, and created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

The live version of the app can be found [here](https://livetodeliver.github.io/ParksAPI/).
